# Elements of different kind (true , false) have a radar and behave differently

- FALSE : go random around and come all together when same kind in radar.
- TRUE : go random around and get away when false are in radar.

Cells comunicate theyr spell, if there are enought cells of different kind around, the cells loose knowledge and change color, doing so the other cells become bigger.
Cells surrounded from cells of the same kind increase the own knowledge back.
When a cell has lost all knowledge changes its kind, and applies to the other behavior.

You can change the options in the CONFIG object to make the game different
